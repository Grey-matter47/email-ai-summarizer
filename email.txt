Dear Mr. Shravan,

I hope this email finds you well!

I came across your post about the exciting developments at Inkers.ai, and I was immediately drawn to the innovative work your team is doing in revolutionizing the construction industry with cutting-edge technologies using AI-driven solutions. My name is Krishna Kumar Pandey, and I am currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering at NSUT, Delhi with a focus on Control Systems. Over the past year, I have been closely following the exceptional work you and your teams have been doing at Inkers.ai and Tresa Motors, and I am truly inspired by the innovation and impact you’ve created in both the AI-driven construction and electric vehicle industries. The recent $3 million funding round you closed with Ashish Kacholia and The School of AI only further fueled my desire to reach out and express my interest in contributing to your work.

A bit about my experience:
Ultralytics YOLOv11 for Real-Time Object Detection: I worked extensively with YOLOv11 for real-time object detection, applying it to various high-dimensional data sets. I fine-tuned the model for improved accuracy in detection and tracking, which gave me hands-on experience in computer vision that could be applied to your Defects AI solution at Inkers.ai.

AI-based Project at AIIMS: While at AIIMS, I was involved in a LSTM-based project aimed at enhancing neurophysiological monitoring for patients during surgeries. I contributed by building deep learning models to predict neural activity in real-time, which could be applied to improve patient outcomes. This experience reinforced my passion for working on impactful AI-driven solutions that solve critical problems.

Mutelfy Music Streaming Platform: I co-developed Mutelfy, a music streaming startup that utilizes the Spotify's, Youtube's and Amazon's Web API for dynamic music recommendations. My focus has been on machine learning for user behavior analysis and recommendation systems. This project has honed my skills in data science, streaming data, and cross-functional collaboration.

Control Systems Project - H2 Hinfinity LMI Controller Design: I recently completed a H2 Hinfinity LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) Controller Design project, where I applied multi-variable control theory to design a robust control system for a dynamic system with uncertainties. The project focused on minimizing the impact of external disturbances while maintaining system stability, which is critical for many high-performance applications such as autonomous vehicles. This work gave me a strong foundation in control theory, which I believe can be valuable in optimizing the performance of systems at Tresa Motors and Inkers.ai.

EV Case Study: During my coursework, I conducted a detailed case study on Electric Vehicles (EVs), focusing on the charging infrastructure and battery management systems (BMS) used globally. I researched the different charging standards (CHAdeMO, CCS, Tesla Supercharger) across Japan, China, the US, India, and Europe, and analyzed their impact on EV adoption and infrastructure. I also delved into the various types of lithium-ion batteries used in EVs, their charging/discharging cycles, and the integration of Battery Management Systems to ensure efficiency, longevity, and safety. This work aligns well with the ongoing developments in Tresa Motors' EV platform, and I believe my insights into the global EV landscape could be a valuable asset.

Beyond my professional experience, I have a strong passion for sports, particularly badminton, where I’ve actively participated in tournaments across town. I believe this hobby not only keeps me physically active but also sharpens my strategic thinking, focus, and determination – qualities that I’m eager to bring to Inkers.ai. And I also like to take long Walks (like 50km long) helps me enjoy and absorb the true raw beauty of the place whenever I'm there.

Why I’m excited about Inkers.ai and Tresa Motors:
At Inkers.ai, I am particularly drawn to your work on Scan-to-BIM technology and Defects AI. Your ability to leverage LiDAR, thermal cameras, and AI for real-time defect detection and milestone tracking is truly groundbreaking. The potential to transform the construction industry using these technologies is incredibly exciting, and I would love the opportunity to contribute to this vision.

At Tresa Motors, the way you are shaping the future of electric vehicles through cutting-edge battery management systems, ADAS, and autonomous vehicle technologies speaks to my passion for sustainable mobility and the future of transportation. I’m eager to contribute to your mission of making electric vehicles more accessible, efficient, and safe.

Why I’m reaching out now:
Given my background in machine learning, AI, control systems, and electric vehicles, I believe now is the ideal time to reach out to discuss potential opportunities where I can contribute to your incredible work. Whether it’s in a technical, research, or development capacity, I am excited by the chance to bring my skills to Inkers.ai and Tresa Motors and make a tangible impact. (Also I'm in Bangalore exploring the city).

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would love the opportunity to connect further and explore how I can contribute to your innovative teams. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
Krishna Kumar Pandey
